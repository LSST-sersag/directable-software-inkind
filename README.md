<h3> Activities within LSST </h3> <br> <br>


<b> 1) Forum discussion on overlapping interests in periodicity mining in LSST
light-curves (hybrid event) organized by SER-SAG, June, 14, 2022 </b>
       <br >
       This discussion forum features the following speakers: Rachel Street, Eric
C. Bellm, Matthew Graham, Andrew Connolly, Ilaria Musella, Claudia M.
Raiteri, Swayamtrupta Panda, Andjelka Kovacevic & SER-SAG, Sally
Macfarlane & David Buckley, Marta Fatovic, Ngeow Chow-Choong, Sara Bonito,
Nina Hernitschek, Massimo Dall’Ora, Anais Moller & Emille Ishida, as
well as the offline contribution by Ioannis Liodakis (slides available).
<br> 

<i> Goals </i>: <br />
The SER-SAG team  appreciate the AGN, TVS, LINCC members  participation in a
discussion forum (hybrid event) on overlapping regimes in periodicity
mining in LSST lightcurves. In parallel with the increase in the number of
scientific cases of periodic signal mining, the fragmentation of
periodicity mining pipelines is also increasing. Examples of situations in
which the same
issue is governed by similar regimes (such as red noise) are becoming
increasingly frequent. <br />

This two hours long  discussion forum  in a hybrid format (online and
in-person), allowed for online participation to increase the diversity of
participants, on June 14, 2022, from 17:00 CEST (11:00 EST/8:00 PST). <br />


Recording from the session is available at
<a href="http://servo.aob.rs/AGN_GL/recordings/5agngl/14_jun/fd/video1.mp4"> http://servo.aob.rs/AGN_GL/recordings/5agngl/14_jun/fd/video1.mp4 </a>

You may see the Google slides that were presented by the representatives
of the LINCC and LSST Science Collaborations here:

The last two slides  feature summary of proposed topics and actions by
participants that might be relevant for the periodicity detection session
at the LSST Project Community Workshop 2022. <br />
