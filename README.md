SER-SAG Periodicity pipeline Inkind contribution: overview of Conditional
Neural Process module for nonparametric light curve modeling

Conditional Neural Processes (CNPs) were created as an expansion of
Generative Query Networks (GQNs) in sense to extend GQN training regime to
tasks such as regression and classification. Here we describe the various
components of a CNP module which is important segment of our pipeline for
periodicity mining, which is part of the SER-SAG in-kind contribution to
the LSST. We contrasted CNP to an example of application of the Deep
Gaussian process. This presentation is not intended to promote specific
algorithms, but rather to demonstrate how our in-kind contribution team
applies nonparametric modeling to AGN light curves in preparation for LSST
data.

The SER-SAG team is currently experimenting with these algorithms and
welcomes feedback from the LSST community.

<b> 3) Forum discussion on overlapping interests in periodicity mining in LSST
light-curves (hybrid event) organized by SER-SAG, June, 14, 2022 </b>
       <br >
       This discussion forum features the following speakers: Rachel Street, Eric
C. Bellm, Matthew Graham, Andrew Connolly, Ilaria Musella, Claudia M.
Raiteri, Swayamtrupta Panda, Andjelka Kovacevic & SER-SAG, Sally
Macfarlane & David Buckley, Marta Fatovic, Ngeow Chow-Choong, Sara Bonito,
Nina Hernitschek, Massimo Dall’Ora, Anais Moller & Emille Ishida, as
well as the offline contribution by Ioannis Liodakis (slides available).
<br> 

<i> Goals </i>: <br />
The SER-SAG team  appreciate the AGN, TVS, LINCC members  participation in a
discussion forum (hybrid event) on overlapping regimes in periodicity
mining in LSST lightcurves. In parallel with the increase in the number of
scientific cases of periodic signal mining, the fragmentation of
periodicity mining pipelines is also increasing. Examples of situations in
which the same
issue is governed by similar regimes (such as red noise) are becoming
increasingly frequent. <br />

This two hours long  discussion forum  in a hybrid format (online and
in-person), allowed for online participation to increase the diversity of
participants, on June 14, 2022, from 17:00 CEST (11:00 EST/8:00 PST). <br />


Recording from the session is available at
<a href="http://servo.aob.rs/AGN_GL/recordings/5agngl/14_jun/fd/video1.mp4"> http://servo.aob.rs/AGN_GL/recordings/5agngl/14_jun/fd/video1.mp4 </a>

The last two slides  feature summary of proposed topics and actions by
participants that might be relevant for the periodicity detection session
at the LSST Project Community Workshop 2022. <br />
